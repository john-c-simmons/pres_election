# Election Prediction through Logistic Regression
##### Authors: Will Cline, CeCe Lacey, John Carter Simmons

## Goals
* We sought to build an accurate predictor of Presidential election outcomes by county for 5 states: California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, and Texas.
* We also sought to determine as a proof of concept whether vaccination rates for the county are useful in vote outcomes.

***
## Methods

* We utilized 2015 and 2019 census data along with geographical and vaccination data by county in tandem with their following yearâ€™s election results.
* 2016 data was used to predict election results of 2020

## Best Model Results

## Next Steps
* Midterm election data may be collected and used on our same model.
* Census and vaccine data for prior years may be collected to enhance model with data of elections from 2000 onward.
* In the upcoming 2024 election, predictions can be made using 2016 and 2020 data for an even more accurate prediction.
