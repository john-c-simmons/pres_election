# Election Prediction through Logistic Regression
##### Authors: Will Cline, CeCe Lacey, John Carter Simmons
***
## Goals
* We sought to build an accurate predictor of Presidential election outcomes by county for 4 states: California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas.
* We also sought to determine as a proof of concept whether vaccination rates for the county are useful in vote outcomes.

***
## Data
We utilized 2015 and 2019 census data along with geographical and vaccination data by county in tandem with their following yearâ€™s election results.2016 data was used to predict election results of 2020
#### Sources:
* Census Data from 2015 and 2019 from Five Year American Community Survey
* Data on Kindergarten vaccination rates from individual states reported at the county level 
* Geographic data from Wikipedia 
* Election data from MIT Election Data + Science Lab

***
## Modeling Process
OSEMN: Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, Interpret
* Obtained data from various sources
* Scrubbed vaccination data, census data, and election data
* Explored all of our data by bringing together and feature engineering
* Model: Created baseline logistic regression model, tried random forest classifier
* Interpret

## Next Steps
* Midterm election data may be collected and used on our same model.
* Census and vaccine data for prior years may be collected to enhance model with data of elections from 2000 onward.
* We would like to include COVID Vaccination rates in predicting midterms or 2024 general election
* In the upcoming 2024 election, predictions can be made using 2016 and 2020 data for an even more accurate prediction.
